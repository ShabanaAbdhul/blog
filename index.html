        <div class="Temperate Forest">
        <h1>Temperate Forest</h1>
        <p align="justify">Temperate forests experience four distinct climate seasons–winter, spring, fall, and summer.
         They consist of oaks, maples, and other deciduous trees as well as seasonal plants. Animals living in temperate forests adapt to winter and fall by hibernating or becoming mostly dormant during cold weather to conserve energy.
         Deciduous forests are found in regions of the Northern Hemisphere that have moist, warm summers and frosty winters—primarily eastern North America, eastern Asia, and western Europe. In contrast, evergreen forests—excepting boreal forests, which are covered in boreal forest—typically grow in areas with mild, nearly frost-free winters. 
         They fall into two subcategories—broad-leaved forests and sclerophyllous forests. (Sclerophyllous vegetation has small, hard, thick leaves.) The former grow in regions that have reliably high, year-round rainfall; the latter occur in areas with lower, more erratic rainfall. Broad-leaved forests dominate the natural vegetation of New Zealand; 
         they are significantly represented in South America, eastern Australia, southern China, Korea, and Japan; and they occur in less well-developed form in small areas of southeastern North America and southern Africa. Sclerophyllous forests occur particularly in Australia and in the Mediterranean region.</p>

        <div class="TropicaL forest">
            <h1>Tropical Forest</h1>
            <p align="justify">Characterized by nearly daily rain showers, high humidity, and temperatures averaging between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, tropical forests are found in the equatorial regions of Africa, Australia, southern Asia, and South America.
                 Tropical rain forests like the Amazon contain a remarkably diverse array of plants and animals compared to boreal or temperate forests.
                 The stability of a tropical forest’s climate and the absence of surface upheavals, like earthquakes or floods, makes it easy for this type of natural environment to support thousands of different animal and plant species.
                 The original tropical rainforests, which covered the planet's land surface, were the type of flora that covered Earth.
                  Other canopy forests expanded north-south of the equator during the Paleogene epoch, around 40 million years ago, as a result of the emergence of drier, cooler climates.</p>

                <div class="Boreal Forests">
                    <h1>Boreal Forests</h1>
                    <p align="justify">Found in the northernmost regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, boreal forests consist mostly of white spruces, jackpines, white birches, and trembling aspens.
                         Glaciers forming during the last Ice Age (between 11,000 and 115,000 thousand years ago) formed the land beneath boreal forest ecosystems.
                        The trees and animals native to boreal forests have successfully adapted to the environment’s cold, dry climate and short, warm seasons.Boreal forests, or taiga, are the Earth's northernmost forests, covering vast tracts of land across Alaska, Canada, northern Europe, and Russia.
                         They are among the world's leading purveyors of ecosystem services, including carbon storage and clean water, and they harbor globally significant wildlife populations.</p>

                <div class="Lakes and ponds">
                    <h1>Lakes and ponds</h1>
                    <p align="justify">A diverse community of animals lives in the shallow waters near the shores of large ponds and lakes where more sunlight can be absorbed and retained. Called the littoral zone, these shallow areas harbor creatures ranging from microscopic diatoms, algae, and hydra to crustaceans, snails, amphibians, and small fish.
                        The littoral zone is a vital part of the lake and pond ecosystem because it provides food for ducks, snakes, turtles, and larger fish.We joke about England and the United States being just "across the pond" from each other, but a real pond is nothing like the ocean that separates these two countries. 
                        While the two bodies of water are inland bodies of freshwater that contain living creatures, the website for the Lilly Center for Lakes & Streams at Grace College in Winona Lake, Indiana, says the primary difference is the depth and surface area of each body of water.</p>

                <div class="Streams and Rivers">
                    <h1>Streams and Rivers</h1>
                    <p align="justify">Water flows mostly in one direction.
                        Instability of water temperatures, water depth, and flow speeds means rivers and streams experience constant modification to their ecosystems.
                        Development and extinction of microhabitats occur frequently as flow and depth fluctuate.
                        Plants and animals living in streams and rivers have certain adaptations that make it easier for them to survive in flowing water.
                        Streams are bodies of water that have a current; they are in constant motion. Geologists recognize many categories of streams depending on their size, depth, speed, and location. Creeks, brooks, tributaries, bayous, and rivers might all be lumped together as streams. In streams, water always flows downhill, but the form that downhill movement takes varies with rock type, topography, and many other factors. 
                        Stream erosion and deposition are extremely important creators and destroyers of landforms and are described in the Erosion and Deposition chapter. </p>
